{- This computes complex numbers in base 2.5-âˆš(-3/4), called the Gosper base
   because it is the scale factor from one Gosper island to the next bigger one.
   The digits are cyclotomic:
    2 3
   6 0 1
    4 5
   For layout of all numbers up to 3 digits, see doc/GosperBase.ps .

  A mantissa is a sequence of limbs. There are two kinds: right-justified,
  for integers, and left-justified, for floating point. Addition is different,
  but multiplication is the same.
